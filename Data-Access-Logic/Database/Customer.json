              "Description": "Make Noise Maths is a Control Voltage Generator and Processor indebted to the classic designs of Don Buchla in his Model 257 and Model 281 function generators.\n   The design of Buchla\u0027s envelopes allowed them to easily switch between cycling and triggered envelopes, providing LFOs as well, and at high enough speeds, Oscillators. \n   This design was then appropriated for the Serge Dual Universal Slope Generator,\n   which is an apt name as it can basically create any kind of rising and falling voltage. \n   Maths continues in this great tradition of versatile and function-packed modules.",
